                    â€œ1) Explain the concept of Responsive Design. What does the term mean?<br>
Responsive design is a way of developing web properties so that the device which is used for determining the way that how the site will be displayed. The first site to show the layout that fixed to browser viewport width was Audi.com launched in late 2001 which was created by a team of four members first is Jurgen Spangl , second is Jim Kalbach, third is Ken Olling and last the forth is Jan Hoffmann.(Referenced). First Responsive web design is very good as it makes easy for us to get flexible layouts, images, and media sheet queries for creating web page. There are number of responsive web design techniques that can be used to create website. Normally developers used major and minor width breakpoint to create the proper and responsive web page. Responsive web design is much preferred by developers as it makes text easier to read and images easier to view. Its layouts adjust automatically and fixed with any different device such as laptop, computer, phone and smartwatch. Increase in number of mobile users there is more demand of developers with knowledge of responsive web design.<br> 

2) How does responsive design relate to web technologies?<br>
To create the web we use JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. Web technologies are techniques and tool used to process of communication between different devises through the internet. Web technologies is nearly like responsive web design in terms of making life easy. For example, web technologies make easy for users to get information from any devices through internet and responsive web design make easy for user in terms of getting fixed in device means it make app to fixed in any device weather it is big as computer or small as phone.<br>

3) What did you learn about building web apps for different devices through your research?<br>
During this semester while attending the lectures and reading the notes I got to know number of things, but the main thing is that CSS, HTML and JavaScript are the three languages used to build the web page or web application. Talking about the CSS it is the language used for describing the proper presentation of web pages. CSS is used for getting colors, layout and fonts of web page. Moving toward the HTML it is used to set the position of image, text and other web element. And at last JavaScript is used to make web page interactive.<br>

4) Finally, describe your learning experience in the course.<br>
Talking from the beginning it was little difficult for me to get the concept of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. But after attending the regular lectures and reading the class notes makes it easy for me in coming weeks. I learned number of things for HTML like tags and attributes, forms, fonts, text, color and background. For CSS I learned the grid, position, Z-index and responsive design. The most interesting thing was use of DOM to generate list, table, image, audio, video and many more. Overall, the experience of this course for semester 2 is awesome but the main things was my professor who is always ready to answer my each and every question. Ending all, it was a good experience for me in this course.<br>
